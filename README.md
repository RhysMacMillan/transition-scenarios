# transition-scenarios
This directory contains materials related to modeling of fuel cycle transition
scenarios performed by ARFC. 

```database/``` contains stagnant information that is read in to help create 
input files. ```input/``` contains files related to modeling specific scenarios and 
projects, each project is a different directory. ```scripts``` contains multiple 
python files that are used to help create input files or perform data analysis. 
```templates/``` contains templates to help create input files.



## scenario_specification.md
This file contains specific details about the transition
scenarios such as fuel mass, composition, and refueling
cycles. The file also identifies some gaps in the current
CYCLUS regarding transition scenarios.

# Predicting the Past Cyclus and Cycamore Benchmarking Project
This is a public repository for the shared development of benchmarking
simulation input data representing the past nuclear fuel cycle in the United 
States and Europe. It is being conducted by undergraduate researchers at the 
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the Advanced Reactors and Fuel
Cycles group. Files for this project are located at ```input/predicting_the_past/```.

To view the work or run a simulation for a particular region, open 
```[region_name].ipynb```.

## REPORT
To view the the report which includes the procedure, results and their
explanations, please view `united_states.ipynb` or `europe.ipynb`.

## Not Ready For Reuse
During development, this work is under sole development by the authors in
preparation for publication in conference proceedings or an archival journal.
