Transition to HALEU reactors
----------------------------

This directory contains the input files and analysis of multiple 
transition scenarios to advanced reactors fuel by High Assay 
Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU). 

Input files:
===========
The input files in the repository are the ``.xml`` input files for 
|Cyclus|. Each of these inputs read in other ``.xml`` files for the 
light water reactors (LWR) currently deployed in the US, the recipes 
for LWR fuel cycle, and the deployment times for the LWRs. These 
files and the |Cyclus| input files are generated by running 
``/transition-scenarios/scripts/create_input.py``.

Definitions for each advanced reactor and their corresponding recipes
are in ``inputs/united_states/reactors/`` and ``inputs/united_states/recipes``, 
respectively. Each of the necessary files are read into the ``.xml`` files 
in ``inputs/`` when |Cyclus| is run. 

Analysis:
=========
The analysis directory contains a jupyter notebook (``analysis/initial_analysis.ipynb``)
to calculate and compare resource requirements of each fuel cycle 
scenario simulated. All of the figures created in the jupyter notebook
are saved in the ``figures/`` directory. 

This directory also contains ``df_to_csv.py`` to record all of the transactions
in the simulation as a ``.csv`` file. The transactions are determined 
based on the function ``transition_metrics.add_receiver_prototype``, which 
gets the transactions from the database and adds a column to record the 
prototype that receives the commodity in that transaction. The script contains 
functions to perform this function by either looping over multiple databases 
(``get_transactions_multiple_outputs``) or for only a single output file 
(``get_transactions_single_output``). This script is needed because the output 
files are relatively large and memory issues are encountered when the 
``transition_metrics.add_receiver_prototype`` function is called inside the 
jupyter notebook.
