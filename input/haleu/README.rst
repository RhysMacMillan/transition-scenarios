Transition to HALEU reactors
----------------------------

This directory contains the input files and analysis of multiple 
transition scenarios to advanced reactors fueled by High Assay 
Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU). 

Inputs:
===========
This directory holds all of the input files for this project.

The input files in the repository are the ``.xml`` input files for 
|Cyclus|. The input files are titled by scenario number, with 
the scenarios defined in the table below. 
Each of the input files read in other ``.xml`` files from the 
``inputs/united_states/`` directory. Because of the modularity of 
the inut files, **|Cyclus| must be called from the ``input/haleu/`` 
directory.** The modular input files include the 
light water reactors (LWR) currently deployed in the US, the recipes 
for LWR fuel cycle, and the deployment times for the LWRs. The LWR 
files and the ``inputs/united_states_2020.xml`` |Cyclus| input files 
are generated by running 
``/transition-scenarios/scripts/create_input.py``. The 
``input/united_states_2020.xml`` was then altered to create the other
scenarios in the directory by adding in necessary input parameters.

Definitions for each advanced reactor and their corresponding recipes
are in ``inputs/united_states/reactors/`` and ``inputs/united_states/recipes``, 
respectively. Each of the necessary files are read into the ``.xml`` files 
in ``inputs/`` when |Cyclus| is run. 

Analysis:
=========
The analysis directory contains a jupyter notebook (``analysis/initial_analysis.ipynb``)
to calculate and compare resource requirements of each fuel cycle 
scenario simulated. All of the figures created in the jupyter notebook
are saved in the ``figures/`` directory. 

This directory also contains ``df_to_csv.py`` to record all of the transactions
in the simulation as a ``.csv`` file. The transactions are determined 
based on the function ``transition_metrics.add_receiver_prototype``, which 
gets the transactions from the database and adds a column to record the 
prototype that receives the commodity in that transaction. The script contains 
functions to perform this function by either looping over multiple databases 
(``get_transactions_multiple_outputs``) or for only a single output file 
(``get_transactions_single_output``). This script is needed because the output 
files are relatively large and memory issues are encountered when the 
``transition_metrics.add_receiver_prototype`` function is called inside the 
jupyter notebook. 

Parametric-study:
=================
This directory contains information related to a parametric study on 
how the facility cap for the fuel fabrication or enrichment facilities for 
the transition to HALEU-fueled reactors. This was performed because of 
observed deficits from the energy demand when different enrichment and
fabrication facilities were used for LEU and HALEU.
